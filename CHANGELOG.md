## What's new in this update ✨

### v2.0

[Announcement]:  
I've been working on this extension since last year and I realized that building and maintaining a high-quality extension on top of an ever-changing product (Notion) requires a lot of skill and time.  
Having said that, I'll still work on this extension and all the existing features will remain free to use.  
Going forward there will be 2 types of new features that come to this extension: the first ones which will be completely free and others that will come under the `pro` tag.  
All `pro` features can be unlocked for lifetime by paying a one-time fee ($5). Please consider this as a means to support your developer. This will encourage me to further maintain this extension and introduce new features.

Payment can be done from inside the Notion Boost extension to use `pro` features. You don't need to pay again for `pro` features even when you use this extension on different browsers or uninstall/reinstall this extension later. If you have any questions or feedback please reach out to me at hey@gourav.io.

Now back to the exciting stuff! I added many features ⭐ and fixed bugs 🐞 in this release:

- ⭐ **Hide backlinks**  
  Added option to hide backlinks section from all pages.

- ⭐ **Disable popup when pasting link**  
  Added option to disable popup which comes when pasting any external URL into Notion page.

- ⭐ **Show code line numbers**  
  Added option to show line numbers for code blocks.

- ⭐ **Enable spellcheck inside code blocks**  
  Added option to enable spellcheck inside code blocks.

- ⭐ **Hide notification icon** `pro`  
  Hide red notification icon from sidebar when it's in closed state and hide notification number from tab title.
- ⭐ **Add more height to page** `pro`  
  Add more height to page by hiding top padding, image cover, & icon.

- 🐞 In outline section, when heading length is too long full heading text will be shown on mouse hover.
- 🐞 "Small text for all pages" setting will work for preview pages also.
- 🐞 "Hide comments section" setting will work for preview pages also.
- 🐞 Emoji in page headings will also reflect in "Outline" section.
- 🐞 Fixed Slash menu not hiding in some cases.

Added [privacy policy](https://gourav.io/notion-boost#privacy-policy) section.  
tldr; Notion Boost extension does not store or send any data from your Notion account.
